# Pixabay Image Search

This is a search app that leverages [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) as a data source.

## Image Search Page 
This is the main screen where users can search for images using keywords. 

### Search Bar
The character limit is 100 and a validation error is triggered if the user tries to enter more than 300 characters.

### Image List
This displays the list of image previews in a grid. Each image is rendered at the same size, and is clickable. Clicking on an image loads the image detail page

### Pagination
Pagination allows for users to navigate through pages of up to 500 images with 30 images on each page.


## Image Details Page
This displays the selected image in a larger version along with any relevant tags.

## Routing
React Router is used to navigate between the image search screen and the image detail screen. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
